# Sampler
This R code will be used for the forthcoming 2nd edition of A Sampler on Sampling, 
written by Bill Williams while at Bell Labs.  The book was published by Wiley, in 1977.
The R code here will enable a reader to recreate the tables and figures in the book.

We hope to have the 2nd edition ready for print in 2018.
More explanations and updates to come!
